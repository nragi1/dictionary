## Purpose
Small dictionary project utilising dictionary API. Allows user to enter a word and then responds with the definition and an audio pronunciation - allows for replayability. 

### Note
I used the playsound library with no prior knowledge about how it works. It seems that the playsound library has issues replaying audio as it uses windows media player. Maybe a different library would work better.
